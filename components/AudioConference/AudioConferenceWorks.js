                <p>Audio-Conferencing is a cloud telephony based system wherein all the participants of the call dial in to a given number to get connected into the call. It’s an advanced calling system where an individual gets connected into a call that’s just starting or ongoing and becomes a part of the conversation in progress. Through audio-conferencing people across multiple locations tune into a common call. On joining a person is greeted by the company’s intended message and gets connected to the others in the conference through a “Demand Pin”. Only those people can join this conference who have the pin. Attendees can join and participate effortlessly in conference call with crystal clear audio.</p>
